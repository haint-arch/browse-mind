\textit{\textbf{Abstract:}} In the era of rapid technological advancements, internet users generate and accumulate extensive browser histories, which often leads to challenges in retrieving previously visited websites. Traditional manual search methods are inefficient and frequently lack precision, particularly when users can only recall partial information about the web pages, such as their titles, content, color schemes, timestamps, or categories.

This thesis explores the application of machine learning to design and implement an intelligent system for querying browser history. The system leverages advanced feature extraction techniques to analyze key attributes of web pages and integrates natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and respond to user queries effectively. Furthermore, the system prioritizes usability by offering an intuitive interface and a seamless user experience, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval of browsing data.

By utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, and NLP, this system aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of browser history management. The proposed solution not only addresses the limitations of existing methods but also offers a novel approach to improving the accessibility and usability of personal browsing records.
